Here you can find a description of standard 3DEM conventions (as proposed by
`Heymann et al. JSB 151(2), 2005, p. 196-207 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2005.06.001>`_
with `corrections <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2005.11.012>`_)
and conventions used by popular software packages if different.

3DEM standard conventions
=========================

Coordinate and rotation convention
----------------------------------

Coordinate convention is right-handed Cartesian coordinate system. 
Display convention is for x-axis to increase from left to right, y-axis to increase from bottom to top, 
and z-axis to increase from back to front (pointing at viewer) as shown:

A positive rotation is defined as clockwise for the object.
A positive rotation is defined as anti-clockwise for the coordinate system when viewed with 
the axis of rotation pointing at the viewer. For example, a rotation from the x-axis to the
y-axis (about the z-axis) is positive. Note that the object will rotate clockwise when the 
coordinate system rotates anti-clockwise.

Euler angles
------------

Traditionally in EM the direction of propagation of the electron beam is thought to coincide 
with z axis, which in addition uniquely specifies xy as the plane in which the data is collected. 
Thus, it is convenient to express the rotations with respect to the z axis. 
By using a ZYZ convention (rotation around the z axis, followed by a rotation around y, and 
another around z), one benefits from the fact that the description bears a simple relation 
to the description of a point on a sphere; that is to say, we can think of the decomposition 
as the description of a point on the sphere (the first two Eulerian angles YZ) and a final 
in-plane rotation (the final Z-Eulerian angle). We denote three respective Euler angles as 
phi (φ), theta (θ), psi (ψ) and the corresponding rotation in matrix notation as a product of three matrices:

**RZ(ψ) RY(θ) RZ(φ)**

Euler angles are three successive axial rotations: 

#) phi, a rotation about the z-axis;
#) theta, a rotation about the y'-axis; and
#) psi, a rotation about the z''-axis.

Recall that it is the matrix at the rightmost end that is applied first. So one might write a
3DEM rotation as (φ, θ, ψ), where φ is applied first, θ second and ψ lastly.

Projection direction
--------------------

Based on definition of Euler angles above, it is easy to see that first two Eulerian angles
(φ, θ) define projection direction, while ψ defines rotation of projection in-plane of projection. 
Thus, as far as projections are concerned ψ is a trivial angle, as its change does not change 
the 'information content' of the projection.

Degeneracy of Euler angles
--------------------------

The range of possible Eulerian angles for an asymmetric structure is 0≤φ≤360, 0≤θ≤180, 0≤ψ≤360). 
However, for each projection whose direction is (φ, θ, ψ) there exists a projection that is 
related to it by an in-plane mirror operation along x-axis and whose direction is (180+φ, 180-θ, -ψ). 
Note the projection direction of the mirrored projection is also in the same range of 
Eulerian angles as all angles are given modulo 360 degrees (i.e., if say φ > 360, then φ = φ - 360, 
also if φ < 0, then φ = φ + 360.
